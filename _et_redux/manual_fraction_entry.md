Click Add Name to add the new aliquot. Increment the counter below to change the number of fractions it contains (you can add more at any time). Press Insert Fraction to add more fractions.

Order the fractions in the data table with the arrows to the left. After entering the required information for each fraction, press "SaveAs Sample".  Navigate to the desired location, then create a new folder for your sample before saving the .redux file inside. SaveAs Sample controls the name and location of where you are saving - use "Close and Save" to save and close out of the project.
