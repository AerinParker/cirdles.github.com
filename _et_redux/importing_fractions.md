Start by adding a new aliquot. Change the Aliquot Name and click Add Name. Then click on Import Fraction Files. 

For an example - open up CM2 and find the folder zircon. Here you will find a multitude of xml files that have been exported from Tripoli. They come in pairs of lead and uranium. Open both of the files the lead and uranium. (z10 for example. ) It will populate one line of the fraction. One row is one fraction.
