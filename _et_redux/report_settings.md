The Report Settings manager gives you the ability to customize the data table on U_Pb Redux. The data table is organized such that the first column is the name of the fraction, and each row represents a fraction.  The data table contains columns and footnotes that are predefined. The Report Settings Manager is organized into the categories: Fraction, Dates, PbcCorr (Common lead corrected) Dates, Composition, Isotopic Ratios, PbcCorr Isotopic Ratios, Correlation Coefficients, Trace Elements, and Fraction repeated. Each category has member columns. The Report Settings Manager allows you to choose and order the categories, and choose an order the columns within each category. Buttons are provided for ordering both categories and columns. To hide or show a single category or column, double-click it or use the hide/show button.  The show ALL or hide ALL buttons hide or show all of the elements at once. After customization you have the ability to export the new report settings to an xml file. You can later load this xml file back into ET_Redux. Lastly, you can save your current report settings as the default model. 

Complete the total ET_Redux experience with our Android mobile app for tablets and phones called CHRONI. With CHRONI, you can download a saved report settings file and use it to format a downloaded aliquot file.

Now the users have four or five different ways of looking at their data. Inside the app one can decide to use which reports settings to view which files.
