ET_Redux provides sophisticated graphical and statistical tools to assist with data ingestion and organization, data reduction, uncertainty propagation, visualizations, publication-ready vectorized tables and plots, and one-click archiving. These include interactive data tables, concordia and weighted mean plots, dynamic decomposition of uncertainties into contributions from individual sources, and algorithms for propagation of systematic uncertainties in tracer calibration and decay constants.1
