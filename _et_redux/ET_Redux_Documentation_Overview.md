ET_Redux is a stand-alone desktop application, produced by CIRDLES.org as the successor to U-Pb_Redux in January, 2015, with the initials "ET" referring to its sponsor [EARTHTIME](http://www.earth-time.org). ET_Redux is cyber infrastructure for geochronologists that automates workflows from sample collection to publicly archiving of results into the NSF-sponsored [Geochron](http://www.geochron.org) community database. ET_Redux exports analysis results as an [aliquot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EARTHTIME/Schema/master/AliquotXMLSchema.xsd) XML file, which can be exported to Geochron or stored and shared as desired.  ET_Redux currently serves the ID-TIMS and LAICP-MS U-Pb geochronology communities and is funded 2014 - 2017 by NSF to extend to U-series analyses.
