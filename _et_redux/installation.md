**Requirements**

Make sure you have the right requirements for U-Pb_Redux. This program runs on WinOS, MacOS, and Linux and requires Java 1.8 or later runtime environment. 

**Install**

To install U-Pb_Redux, first download and unzip this distribution:
[U-Pb_Redux  Distribution (dist.zip)](http://www.earth-time.org/projects/upb/public_software/U-Pb_Redux/fullDistribution/dist.zip). This contains a number of third-party libraries that U-Pb_Redux depends  on, but that do not need to be re-installed for each update.

Next, unzip the downloaded "dist.zip" file in a convenient location.  To make your version up-to-date, download the current release below and replace U-Pb_Redux.jar  which is in the the existing copy in the "dist" folder.

*ALSO: download and add these 2 files to your /dist/lib folder: [xsom-20100725.jar](http://cirdles.org/sites/default/files/Downloads/xsom-20100725.jar)  and  [relaxngDatatype-1.5.jar](http://cirdles.org/sites/default/files/Downloads/relaxngDatatype-1.5.jar)*
