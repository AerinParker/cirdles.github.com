Use the Aliquot Manager to organize the input parameters for the fractions in an aliquot, collate notes and metadata about the aliquot, and archive the reduced data to a database. To access the Aliquot Manager, click *Aliquots* and select the aliquot you would like to view or just click the aliquot's name in the main window. The Aliquot manager will open in a new window. The Aliquot Manager has five tabs situated near the bottom of the window.

**Fraction Fast Details Tab**

The *Fraction Fast Details* tab is the first tab you will see after opening the Aliquot manager. It contains a table with a row for each fraction and a column for each possible input reduction parameter organized into four groups which are broken down into further groups:

1. Laboratory Data
	* Fraction Name
	* No Initial Pb
	* Tracer Model
	* Tracer Mass, Uncertainty
	* Fraction Mass
	* Pb Fractionation model
	* U Fractionation model
2. Common Pb
	* Pb Blank IC model
	* Pb Blank mass, uncertainty
	* Initial Pbc IC model
	* Estimated date
	* Pbc model uncertainty
3. Uranium
	* Sample <sup>238</sup>U/<sup>235</sup>U, uncertainty
	* Blank <sup>238</sup>U/<sup>235</sup>U, uncertainty
	* U Blank mass, uncertainty
	* Uoxide <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O, uncertainty
4. Initial Isotopic Disequilibrium
	* Th/U of magma, uncertainty
	* <sup>231</sup>Pa/<sup>235</sup>U activity ratio, uncertainty

**Fraction Notes Tab**

The *Fraction Notes* tab displays a concatinated list of the fractions in the aliquot and their corresponsing notes.

**Fraction Archiving Details Tab**

The *Fraction Archiving Details* tab allows you to edit the archiving details of your fractions.

**References, Metadata and Consistency Tab** 

The *References, Metadata and Consistency* tab allows you to edit the references and metadata for your aliquot.

**Archive Aliquot to Database Tab**

The *Archive Aliquot to Database* tab allows you to archive your aliquot to a database using its IGSN number which you set with the Sample Manager.
