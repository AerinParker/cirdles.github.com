   <dt>Aliquots</dt>
   <dd>
      Aliquots are physical pieces of a sample whose dates can be interpreted seperately. For instance, zircon and titanite mineral separates could be two aliquots. Pieces of a sample sent to two different labs, or whose mineral separation was performed with two different techniques, would also be two aliquots. They are some derivative of the sample that is analyzed, such as a mineral separate. If a piece of sample is held in reserve for future analysis, it is a unique aliquot. An aliquot is the basic unit of aggregate analysis for a sample that the CIRDLES architecture archives. Aliquots and their associated data analyzes and interpretations form the basis for the archival records in the CIRDLES architecture.

   <dt>Data Reduction</dt>
   <dd>
      The transformation of information into an ordered, simplified form by reducing it to meaningful parts.
   </dd>

   <dt>EARTHTIME</dt>
   <dd>
      An initiative to facilitate cooperation among geochronologists with the goal of sharing ideas and approaches for eliminating or minimizing interlaboratory and intertechnique biases. Read more <a href="http://www.earth-time.org">here</a>.
   </dd>

   <dt>End-to-end Data Processing</dt>
   <dd>
      A system that takes a raw data input and transforms it into archived analysis results.
   </dd>

   <dt>Fractions</dt>
   <dd>
      A fraction encapsulates the isotopic data for an analyzed volume of a mineral without being lab specific. A fraction is paired U+Pb analysis. For instance, a zircon analyzed by TIMS or a spot zapped by LA-ICPMS would be separate fractions, even if both analyzed the same grain.

   <dt>GeoChron</dt>
   <dd>
      A community-based database and World Wide Web portal for data access that serves U-Pb geochronology. It is a joint project of EARTHTIME and EarthChem. Read more <a href="http://geochronportal.org">here</a>.

   <dt>IGSN (International Geo Sample Number)</dt>
   <dd>
      A unique identifier given to a sample.
   </dd>

   <dt>Metadata</dt>
   <dd>
      Data about the sample.
   </dd>


   <dt>Sample</dt>
   <dd>
      A single collection of a geologic material (usually rock or mineral) from one location. A sample has a lab specific name and a unique identifier such as the IGSN provided by SESAR.
   </dd>

   <dt>SESAR (System for Earth Sample Registration)</dt>
   <dd>
      A centralized registry that provides unique identifiers for samples. Read more <a href="http://www.geosamples.org">here</a>
   </dd>

   <dt>Uncertainty Propogation</dt>
   <dd>
      The process of determining the error of a calculation's result.
   </dd>

   <dt>XML (Extensible Markup Language)</dt>
   <dd>
      The modeling language CIRDLES uses to model logical data models. XML is an emerging standard for modeling data because it provides for precise declarations of data that are independent of any specific presentation of data, andy software or any specific hardware. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines XML at <a href="http://www.w3.org/">www.w3.org/XML</a>.
