*Sample* - A single collection fo a geologic material from one location. This name is shared by each of the sample's fractions, or U/Pb analyses. You don't have to give the .redux file or the folder that contains it the exact same name as the sample. However, when you export an analysis from Tripoli for Redux, you must provide the sample name correctly, or Redux won't recognize it. A sample name may not contain space--use hyphens or underscores instead.

To upload your sample to the GeoChron database, you may request an IGSN, or International Geologic Sample Number, through SESAR [(www.geosamples.org)](www.geosamples.org). ET_Redux will guide you through this process when you publish from the Aliquot page.

*Aliquots* - Aliquots are physical pieces of a sample whose dates you wish to interpret separately. For instance, zircon and titanite mineral separates could be two aliquots. Pieces of a sample sent to two different labs, or whose mineral separation was performed with two different techniques, would also be two aliquots.

New aliquots may be added at any time to an existing sample. In this window, type a new name ( over an existing name) in the Aliquot Name dialog box, increment the counter below to number of fractions it contains (you can add more fractions at any time), and then select "Add Name".

*Fractions* - A fraction is paired U+Pb analysis. For instance, a zircon analyzed by TIMS or a spot zapped by LA-ICPMS would be separate fractions, even if both analyzed the same grain.

To add fractions to this sample choose an aliquot at left, increment the counter found to the right of the ?Insert Fractions? button to the desired number of fractions, then click "Add Fractions". Fractions may be removed by clicking the red X on the left side of its row in the table. If you have already made U/Pb measurements and exported them from Tripoli (as .xml files), you can import them from this window. Click the "Import Fraction Files" button, then navigate to and select the analyses you want to import. You can hold control or shift to select multiple .xml files. If these are the first fractions created for this sample, your sample will automatically be given the name from the imported file.

*Metadata* - Data about the sample.
