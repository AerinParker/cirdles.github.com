<p id="aliquot">Aliquot- phsyical pieces of a sample whose dates you wish to interpret seperately.</p>

<p id="fraction">Fraction- a paired U+Pb analysis</p>

<p id="live_workflow">Live Workflow- establishes a direct link between Tripoli (another CIRDLES software product) and ET_Redux.</p>

<p id="project">Project- collection of samples</p>

<p id="sample">Sample- A single collection of a geologic material (usually rock or mineral) from one location. A sample has a lab specific name and a unique identifier such as the IGSN provided by SESAR. It is composed of aliquots or physical pieces of the sample.</p>

<p id="data_reduction">Data Reduction- The transformation of information into an ordered, simplified form by reducing it to meaningful parts.</p>

<p id="earthtime">EARTHTIME- An initiative to facilitate cooperation among geochronologists with the goal of sharing ideas and approaches for eliminating or minimizing interlaboratory and intertechnique biases. Read more <a href="http://www.earth-time.org">here</a>.</p>

<p id="end_to_end_data_processing">End-to-end Data Processing- A system that takes a raw data input and transforms it into archived analysis results.</p>

<p id="fractions">Fractions- A fraction encapsulates the isotopic data for an analyzed volume of a mineral without being lab specific. A fraction is paired U+Pb analysis. For instance, a zircon analyzed by TIMS or a spot zapped by LA-ICPMS would be separate fractions, even if both analyzed the same grain.</p>

<p id="geochron">GeoChron- A community-based database and World Wide Web portal for data access that serves U-Pb geochronology. It is a joint project of EARTHTIME and EarthChem. Read more <a href="http://geochronportal.org">here</a>.</p>

<p id="igsn">IGSN (International Geo Sample Number)- A unique identifier given to a sample.</p>

<p id="metadata">Metadata- Data about the sample</p>

<p id="sesar"> Sesar (System for Earth Sample Registration)- A centralized registry that provides unique identifiers for samples. Read more <a href="http://www.geosamples.org">here</a></p>

<p id="uncertainty_propagation">Uncertainty Propagation- The process of determining the error of a calculation's result.</p>

<p id="xml">XML (Extensible Markup Language)- The modeling language CIRDLES uses to model logical data models. XML is an emerging standard for modeling data because it provides for precise declarations of data that are independent of any specific presentation of data, andy software or any specific hardware. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines XML at <a href="http://www.w3.org/">www.w3.org/XML</a>.</p>
