The Workflow Manager in ET_Redux allows you to organize your input data before measurement. Here you can specify the sample name, IGSN, and the name of each of your aliquots and fractions. Before you begin, decide whether to use Live Workflow or the default - Manual Workflow in order to obtain your fractions. Then you can set fraction parameters like the tracer's defined data model, tracer mass, and fraction mass.

 **Live Workflow Mode**

Live Workflow mode in ET_Redux creates a shared workspace between ET_Redux and Tripoli which allows the two programs to interact in real time. When Tripoli is also in Live Workflow mode, it updates files in a shared workspace as data is collected from a mass spectrometer and processed by you.

**Manual Workflow Mode**

In Manual Workflow mode you import measured data from fraction files which are saved as XML documents. Tripoli produces such files. ET_Redux will also automatically retrieve metadata from those files such as the sample name.
