ET_Redux is the flagship cyber infrastructure product of CIRDLES, the Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth Sciences, an undergraduate research lab at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina. ET_Redux was previously known as U-Pb_Redux, but in January of 2015, was renamed to reflect its expanding functionality and its sponsor, EARTHTIME (EARTH-TIME.org).

ET_Redux currently serves the ID-TIMS and LAICP-MS U-Pb geochronology communities as described [here](http://cirdles.org/sites/default/files/Downloads/ggge1933.pdf) and [here](http://cirdles.org/sites/default/files/Downloads/ggge1932.pdf).

We have recently received NSF funding to extend the architecture to Uranium series analyses, as explained [here](http://earthcube.org/group/cyberinfrastructure-u-series-geochronologic-data).
