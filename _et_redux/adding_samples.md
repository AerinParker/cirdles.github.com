To create a new sample click Sample > New Sample Analysis for ID-TIMS. A ID-TIMS workflow management dialog will appear. Here you will find all you need in creating and adding aliquots. Name your sample using the Local Sample Name dialog box. 

To create a new aliquot, start by typing in a descriptive name, such as “zircon”, into the Aliquot Name dialog box. Then press Add Name. From here there are two directions you can go: importing fraction files or manually entering in a fraction.
