Once you have obtained your SESAR ID you can use this to register a sample. Your sample will be given a unique IGSN number. ET_Redux uses the IGSN as a source for metadata. You can now pull all of the metadata from SESAR to process the sample and ET_Redux can upload the data processing into Geochron - selecting public will make the samples viewable on a map. This functionality will allow samples to be viewable throughout the world.
