Run ET_Redux and you will be presented with a welcome screen. Click "Open Sample" at the bottom of the window. You will be prompted to select a Redux sample file. Browse to where you placed the unzipped synthetic data. Select a file with the .redux extension in CM*/CM*_Redux/. A table containing your data will appear on the screen. From here you can view graphs and generate concordia graphs.
