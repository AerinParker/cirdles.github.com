Squid 3.0 was proposed as the project name for replacing Squid 2.50 during the VIII SHRIMP 2016 Workshop in Granada.

During 2016, Jim Bowring and Simon Bodorkos produced the open-source program Calamari as a proof-of-concept that we could 
successfully port the arithmetic of Ken Ludwig's Squid 2.5 to Java.  

The details of Simon's explorations and
explanations of Squid 2.5 to date are found here:

The program Calamari is explained <a href="https://github.com/bowring/Calamari/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.

The latest version of Calamari is <a href="https://github.com/bowring/Calamari/releases">here</a>.
