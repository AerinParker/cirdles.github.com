After setting up the mapping, all of the samples will be listed in the window with pertinent metadata. Click on the arrow in a row to display information about how the data will be mapped.
Click on the checkboxes to select the samples that will be uploaded to SESAR's test database. Then click the Upload button in the top right corner, and the samples will be uploaded to SESARâ€™s test database. If the upload is successful, after a few seconds the IGSN field will be populated for each sample selected to be uploaded. If you want to verify that the samples uploaded, you can view your samples by logging in to [SESAR](https://geopass.iedadata.org/josso/).
