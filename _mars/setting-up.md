1. Before developing, you must have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Node Package Manager) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). npm is used for managing dependencies for CirdlesWebUI. If you do not have Node.js and npm on your computer you will need to install Node and npm comes installed with it. Follow the instructions to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. You will also need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you have not done so already and follow the step by step directions to install git.

3. Please read the [CirdlesWebUI](https://github.com/CIRDLES/CirdlesWebUI) repository for more information regarding development of CirdlesWebUI projects

<i>Note: MARS is currently in the development stage, so MARS uses SESARâ€™s test database and there may be developer tools visible to you.</i>
