Middleware for Assisting the Registration of Samples (MARS) is a project of Working Group 4 of the Internet of Samples (iSamples) NSF-funded Research Coordination Network (RCN). MARS is being developed to explore the automation of registering legacy samples at SESAR (System for Earth Sample Registration) with pertinent metadata and a IGSN (International GeoSample Number). The initial targeted repository is the cores collection of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. MARS has not been released for commercial release yet and the current prototype uses SESARâ€™s test database.
