*The current documentation applies to Chroni version 1.0.1*

Currently, CHRONI only supports Android devices. Due to the current layout sizes, the application works best on tablets.

<b>Installation and Beyond</b>

1. Install our most recent CHRONI APK from our [Releases](https://github.com/CIRDLES/CHRONI/releases).
	* Note: if using a computer to download the APK, simply send the file to your device via email.
	* Select the application from the dropdown menu on your device and hit install.
2. In a location where your device receives internet connection, open the CHRONI application.
	* Internet connection is needed to initialize the application because the default Report Settings file must be fetched from [cirdles.org](https://cirdles.org).
3. Congratulations! Your CHRONI application is officially setup! Now, you can utilize the following features:
	* Open - View your aliquot in a custom format as specified by your current Report Settings file
	* History - Review your last ten aliquot files with the click of a button!
	* Profile - Specify your Geochron Portal account information in order to retrieve private aliquot files.


<b>Downloading Aliquot Files</b><br>

An aliquot file is an XML file that contains data on a specifc rock sample.
CHRONI uses report settings to display this data in an aliquot data table.

When downloading aliquot files from <a href="http://geochron.org/detritalsearch.php" target="_blank">geochron</a>, simply type in the IGSN number into the download bar
of the aliquot activity, then press the download button. To view this aliquot, you then need to open it
in the file browser by click the add button, selecting your aliquot, then pressing open.
<br><br>
The other way to download an aliquot is by downloading it from outside of the app. When downloading outside
of CHRONI, the aliquot file will be located in the download file of your device. CHRONI has a new import
 feature where you can click the file you want to pull files from and it will automatically pull aliquot
 and report setting files and insert them into the correct CHRONI folders. This feature can be accessed
 from the menu bar.
