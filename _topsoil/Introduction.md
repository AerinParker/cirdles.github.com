Topsoil is a free and open-source, cross-platform application and library written in Java that creates interactive data visualizations for geochronological data. “Topsoil” is an anagram of “Isoplot”, the name of an enormously successful Microsoft Excel Add-In with similar capabilities developed by Kenneth Ludwig, which now works only in older versions of Excel. 

Geochronology is concerned with determining the age of rock samples. Dr. Kenneth Ludwig of the Berkeley Geochronology Center (BGC) developed Isoplot as a means for geochronologists to create visualizations for their data in Excel, as well as to perform common analyses and calculations. Currently, no version of Excel supports Isoplot past Excel 2010. Because Isoplot is no longer maintained, it is incompatible with recent versions of Excel, and because its code isn’t freely available, using it today can be impractical or impossible.

Isoplot, a Visual Basic add-in for Microsoft Excel for analyzing and visualizing geochronological data addresses these issues by taking a community-driven approach to development, eliciting and responding to feedback from users to direct project action, and by releasing the code on GitHub for anyone to see or modify.

Topsoil is developed by a rotating team of students in the Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth Sciences (CIRDLES) at the College of Charleston, under the direction of Dr. James Bowring. It can be run on any platform with Java installed, and its code is available freely on GitHub.
