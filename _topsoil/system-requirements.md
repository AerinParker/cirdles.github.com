Topsoil will run on Windows (x86 and x64), Linux (x86 and x64), and Mac (x64 only). Topsoil requires the latest version of Java (1.8 or higher), the installer for which can be found <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you are unsure which Java version you have active on your system, we provide a tool, javacheck-0.1.0.jar, on the <a href="https://github.com/CIRDLES/topsoil/releases" target="_blank">releases page</a> to assist you. Simply download the file and double-click it. It requires a JRE (1.3 or newer) to run.
