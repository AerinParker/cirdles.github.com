Topsoil uses GitHub to host its code and for version control, and it uses GitHub “Issues” to track bugs, suggestions, or requests reported by users. In order to create an Issue on GitHub, simply go to Topsoil’s repository and click the “Issues” tab, then click “New Issue.” Alternatively, the Help menu within Topsoil contains a “Report Issue” button, that will open the new issue form in a browser window.

In addition to taking cues from its community, Topsoil accepts code contributions from its community. Issues that are introductory-level or simple for someone who isn’t familiar with the code are marked as such. Any user who wants to take on one of these issues, create a custom data template, or make other changes is free and able to do so.
