[Brittany Johnson](https://cirdles.cs.cofc.edu/rsrc/contacts/johnson.png, an undergraduate researcher with CIRDLES, won first place in The Annual SCAMP Undergraduate Research Conference Friday, October 9, 2009, at Allen University, Columbia, South Carolina. Her division was Mathematics and Computer Science. Brittany reported on her successful and ongoing development of a domain-specific open-source help engine for geochemists using CIRDLES' flagship product U-Pb_Redux. This year’s state-wide conference theme was “Embarking on the Pathway to Success: Energizing Minority Education through Research Collaborations." SCAMP is the South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation. Brittany's help engine is due for release in early 2010.
