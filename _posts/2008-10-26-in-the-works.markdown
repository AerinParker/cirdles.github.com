Sorry it has been so long since we last put up some updates. It has been a hectic past few weeks. Soon we will have up on the site the updates mentioned in the previous blog. Also, I have been working on the help for the program, so that has been keeping me busy. There have been a few technical difficulties along the way concerning new computers and logon problems, but they are being dealt with and we will have more updates for you as soon as we can!
