Hey everyone! It's a new year and new things are blossoming with CIRDLES. We are glad to welcome a new addition to the CIRDLES team. His name is Jonathan Tashakori (his picture and info are currently in the people section of the site). We will also be welcoming in May a foreign exchange student from France, which we are looking forward to. The help has been coming along very nicely. We are trying to find more and more ways to make it more useful, efficient, and helpful for everyone.
